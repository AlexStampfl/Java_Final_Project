# Student Survey Java Final Project
### Description
This is my final project for my semester one **Java** class.
The project is a student survey and tally counting app.
It asks the users questions and keeps track of the answers.

The student survey is rendered to the console/terminal where you can select your answers to each question and see the results.

### How to Install and Run the Project
The easiest way to run the program is with visual studio code (vsc). Simply download the java extension in vsc and you should be good to go.
